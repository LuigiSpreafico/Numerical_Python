# The goal
The goal is to make the computer modeling of various problems and compare them to its analitical solutions whenever possible.

# The Software
The projects use:
* Python; version: 3.11.5
* Numpy; vers√£o: 1.24.3

# SchrodingerEquation_infinite_potential_well
This program aims to show the analitical solution the quantum mechanical problem of the one-dimensional infinite potential well and compare to a numerical solution.
